A coach of a school chess club wants to start a mentoring program for newer players. Each player has an integer rating representing skill level. The coach would like to pair up students whose ratings differ by no less than a given minimum. What is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed?

 

Example

n = 6

rating = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

minDiff = 4

 

There are n = 6 players. Two pairs of players have a difference of 4 or more: those with ratings (1, 5) and (2, 6).
 

Function Description

Complete the function maxPairs in the editor below. The function must return an integer that represents the maximum number of pairs that the coach can form.

 

max Pairs has the following parameter(s):

    rating:  an array of integers denoting the ratings of the players

    minDiff: the minimum difference in skill levels of the players in a pair

 

Constraints

    1 < n < 105
    0 < minDiff < 109
    1 < rating[i] < 109

 
Input Format For Custom Testing

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of players.

Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 1 â‰¤ i < n) contains an integer skillLevel[i], the skill level of the player i.

The last line of the input contains the integer minDiff, the minimum difference in skill levels of the players in a pair.
